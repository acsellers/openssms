# OpenSuccess

Maybe I'll write an Open Source Student Success Management System in May 2019...

Using my stack of:

* Postgres
* Echo.go
* Vue.js (and vue-router, vuex, Vuetify)
* Go

Since EAB didn't want to write the next generation student success application in that stack, I'll do it myself. But first, I have to let my non-compete run out.
